	20 July 2018. We were given a lesson on HTML5 and afterwards did a test on animate and photoshop.
	It was wonderful to see everyone have so much fun creating their websites.
	Everyone was being so cute, adding gifs, texts, images and having fun.

	14 July 2018. You all surprised be with mothers' day out of nowhere.
	Of course you would get me.
	Got card some more without me even knowing.
	No one told me a thing.
	From that day on, I knew I could trust you all.
	So coordinated and so tight-lipped, what is there not to be happy about.

	Mr Melvin, I thought when you say HTML5 it was going to be hard since the differences between 4 and 5 are quite something. Yay.

	Of course I would be worried about everyone's health.
	I'm the mummy of T106.
	I will miss this class when we graduate.
	But, that is my job.
	I want to ensure that you all grow to become independent and strong.
	A parent's job is to put themselves out of the job.
	When I miss you all, that means I've done my job.

	I really think you're letting me in your life.
	Idk why.
	You keep those around you cool and relaxed, even though inside and outside things are getting to you.
	I'll say this one more time.
	Grades do matter, but not the way we are taught it to be.
	Your parents will love you for who you are.
	Replace "Your parents" with "Everyone who loves you" and you've got the most common love advise in the world.
	Have fun~

	<p>
	Every time I read this card, I have to turn my brain on to translate the other language.
	Thanks.
	It's time to jump up in the air~ (Jump up in the air)
	Jump up, don't be scared~ (Jump up, don't be scared)
	Jump and all your cares will soar away~
	And if the dark clouds start to swirl (Dark clouds start to swirl)
	Don't fear, don't shed a tear, 'cause
	I'll be your 1UP girl~
